## Automated Detection and Classification of Jigsaw Puzzle Pieces in Digital Images

The images found in the data folder are sourced from kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/etaifour/jigsawpuzzle)


The current code is found in the notebook in the src folder.

I was able to find another person doing something similar(https://github.com/rikyeahh/puzzle-piece-classification/tree/main)
The code can be found in the second notebook.
